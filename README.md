BabylonJS first steps
=====================

Those are my first steps on BabylonJS.

After you have cloned the repository :

* `npm install`
* `grunt serve` will launch an http server for the `src` folder

Those steps are not mandatory, but it can be comfortable to have an http server.

You can generate the API doc of `/src/js/custom/gameTry/cone.js` by running `npm run jsdoc`.

Though, you will need to have jsdoc, if you don't, just run : `npm install jsdoc -g`
